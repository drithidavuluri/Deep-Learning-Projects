# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains six small projects showcasing the implementation of various deep learning techniques. Each project focuses on a specific application and utilizes different neural network architectures and algorithms. The projects included are:

Churn Modeling with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): This project demonstrates the use of an Artificial Neural Network for churn prediction in a business setting. The ANN model is trained on customer data to predict the likelihood of customers churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Cat-Dog Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network is trained to classify images of cats and dogs. The CNN architecture is designed to effectively extract features from images and make accurate predictions, showcasing the power of deep learning in image classification tasks.

Google Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices of Google using a Recurrent Neural Network. The RNN model is trained on historical stock data, capturing temporal dependencies and making predictions based on past price patterns.

Credit Card Applications using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): The Self-Organizing Map algorithm is employed in this project to analyze credit card applications. The SOM model clusters and visualizes the applications based on similarities, aiding in fraud detection and decision-making.

Movie Recommender System using Boltzmann Machines: This project utilizes Boltzmann Machines, a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, to build a movie recommender system. By learning patterns and preferences from user data, the model suggests relevant movies based on a user's preferences and similarities with other users.

Autoencoders for Image Denoising: Autoencoders, a type of neural network architecture, are employed for image denoising in this project. The model is trained to remove noise from corrupted images, showcasing the capabilities of deep learning in image restoration tasks.

Each project is implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
